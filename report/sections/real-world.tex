\section{Real World Implementation}
No part of this project has been implemented on a physical system, but the software has been developed with the goal that it \emph{could} be implemented on a real robot.

\subsection{Using ROS 2}
The main way to use the developed behavior algorithms, is by running the ROS 2 node included in the project. The node requires {\color{red} LiDAR, camera and localization algorithm provided on the ?? topics}.

\subsection{Using the Rust Library}
The most portable way to run the implemented behaviors, is by using the {\color{red} provided} \texttt{botbrain} library. It makes it possible to create a \texttt{Robot} which can calculate control commands given sensor input. This makes it possible to run the behaviors on systems that do not run ROS 2.
