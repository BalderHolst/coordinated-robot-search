\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem-statement}

This project focuses on developing distributed algorithms that enable collaborative robot search for a predefined object within a predefined and mapped environment. During a search mission, the environment is progressively explored until the target object is located. The effectiveness of each search algorithm is evaluated using two parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Map coverage over time
      % TODO: Comparison of time to find search object?
      % Using the same start configuration of the robots but with different behaviors?
    \item The computational expense of the algorithm
\end{itemize}

All software developed in this project is tested exclusively in simulation; therefore, the specific communication technology is not defined. Robots are, however, constrained by a limited communication range, and the behavior algorithms should ensure that robots remain within this range to emulate real-world communication constraints. Each robot is equipped with a camera for detecting the search object and a LiDAR sensor for measuring distances to objects. \\

To evaluate the algorithms and demonstrate their feasibility and support easy integration for ROS 2 based systems, they are implemented as ROS 2 nodes for simulation in Gazebo. \\

The project also includes the development of a simple simulation environment, which facilitates the development of search algorithms by providing visual debugging capabilities without depending on ROS 2 stack, enabling a faster iteration cycle. This environment also supports training agents using reinforcement learning.
