\label{sec:problem-statement}

% TODO: Make sure that the number of parameters is correct
This project focuses on developing distributed algorithms that enable collaborative robot search for an item within a predefined and mapped environment. During a search mission, the environment is progressively explored until the target item is located. The effectiveness of each search algorithm is evaluated using two parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Map coverage over time
    \item The computational expense of the algorithm
\end{itemize}

All software developed in this project is tested exclusively in simulation; therefore, the specific communication technology is not defined. However, robots are constrained by a limited communication range, and the behavior algorithms should ensure that robots remain within this range to emulate real-world communication constraints. Each robot is equipped with a camera for detecting the search item and a LiDAR sensor for measuring distances to objects. \\

To evaluate the algorithms and demonstrate their feasibility, they are implemented as ROS 2 nodes for simulation in Gazebo. \\

% TODO: "Remove dependency on ROS 2 stack"
The project also includes the development of a simple simulation environment, which facilitates the development of search algorithms by providing visual debugging capabilities without depending on ROS 2, enabling a faster iteration cycle. This environment also supports training agents using reinforcement learning.
