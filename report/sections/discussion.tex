\section{Discussion}
Hypothesis 1: 
As seen in \cref{} the gradient-based algorithm outperforms the baseline obstacle-avoidance algorithm but at a higher cost, see \cref{}.
This hypothesis can be confirmed.

\\
Hypothesis 2:
As seen in \cref{} the hybrid algorithm outperforms the gradient-based algorithm but at a lower average cost, see \cref{}. It was not expected to have a lower avegarge cost than the purely gradient-based approach, as the hybrid algorithm combines both gradient-based navigation and high-level path planning.
This hypothesis can not be confirmed.

\\
Hypothesis 3:
From \cref{} it was observed that the lightweight simulator can approximate the key performance characteristics of a high-fidelity simulator like Gazebo, while offering significantly reduced computational requirements. The results are not the exact same but the trends of the search-algorithms carries from \texttt{simple\_sim} to Gazebo. The differences are attributed to the differences in the simulator implementations.

\\
Hypothesis 4:
Not relevant A.T.M.
