# TODO list

- [x] Realsense? NO
- [x] Update URDF (remove imu?)
- [x] Localization in multi-robot enviornment
- [x] ROS2 Messaging between robots
- [x] Multi-threaded simple simulation
- [x] Proximity Grid

- [x] Use lidar again for search algorithms

#### Tune Simulations

- [x] Match robot parameters in simulations
- [x] Create ROS2 data logger
- [x] Compare ROS2 and simple_sim output for same scenario
    - [x] Create coverage logger node

#### Benchmarks

- [x] Measure data transfer
- [x] Plot data transfer
- [x] Measure "robot spread" as a parameter
- [x] Plot "robot spread"
- [x] Measure performance

#### Reinforcement Learning

- [ ] Train a network for a very long time
- [ ] Add proximity penalty

#### Report

- [ ] Find examples of bandwidth
- [x] Compare manual search algorithms

#### Repository

- [x] Document `botbrain` library
