# TODO list
- [x] Realsense? NO
- [x] Update URDF (remove imu?)
- [x] Localization in multi-robot enviornment
- [x] ROS2 Messaging between robots
- [x] Multi-threaded simple simulation
- [x] Proximity Grid
- [x] Show search grid as overlay in Rviz
- [x] Pathing
- [x] ROS2 Image Recognition
- [x] Look into machine learning

#### Manual Algoritm
- [ ] Tune pathing
- [ ] Use robot angle when pathing
- [ ] Repath if lidar sees obstacle
- [ ] Use lidar again for search algorithms

#### Tune Simulations
- [ ] Match robot parameters in simulations
- [ ] Create ROS2 data logger
- [ ] Compare ROS2 and simple_sim output for same scenario

#### Benchmarks
- [ ] Measure data transfer
- [ ] Plot data transfer
- [ ] Measure "robot spread" as a parameter
- [ ] Plot "robot spread"
- [ ] Measure performance

#### Reinforcement Learning
- [ ] Train a network for a very long time
- [ ] Add proximity penalty

#### Report
- [ ] Find examples of bandwidth (for report)
- [ ] Create missing figures
- [ ] Compare manual search algorithms (in report)
